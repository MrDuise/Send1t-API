# Send1t

### “Connecting people around the world!”
<p>The purpose of this project is to make a mobile application that satisfies the basic needs of a modern communication platform. This means that it will require a user to send instant messages with other users one-on-one in real-time, as well as be able to send a message to a group of people at the same time. This Repo is the API. 

The Front-End can be found here: https://github.com/MrDuise/Send1t-Client
<p>The problem that this projects solves is my own lack of understanding in a technology I use every single day. Mobile telecommunications is something that most everyone uses, from other software such as Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and many others. It's something that is needed in every field, in almost every walk of life. But like the washing machine, most people don’t know how it works, and when it breaks, someone else needs to fix it. 

<p>The purpose of this project is to fix my lack of understanding, as I seek to better myself in the ways of modern communication while at the same time developing an exceptional mobile chat app. 

## Installation

To install this project insure that you have Node and NPM installed. This is an Express API and will not work without Node
1. fork the main branch, then clone the repo
2. ```npm install``` to download the dependinces 
3. ```npm run start``` to start it up

This will get it running on your localhost, allowing access through Postman or some other API testing tool.

The postman collection used for testing can be found within the 'Extras' folder


## Technologies and Logical System Architecture
<p>This diagram shows the design of the logical solution of this project. A primary focus of this project is to design it in N-tier architecture, so each tier of the project, and the details of that layer, are displayed in this diagram. This diagram also serves to list the technologies used in this project and the role they played.
To summarize, the project will consist of a client layer, presentation layer, business layer, and a data access layer. The problem with Javascript based projects is that data access is not enforced in any way, requiring the developer to key the data access layers in mind. The only time the general rule of n-layer was semi broken is in the web-socket connection, in which this layer directly talks to the database throught the data access layer.

## Detailed Technical Design
### General Technical Approach
<p>Send1t is a MERN(Mongo, Express, React Native, Node) Stack application developed using N-layer and Model, View, Controller architecture. The back-end portion of the application was written with the JavaScript programming language, whereas the front-end of Send1t was be designed designed using simple tools such as draw.io and written using React Native. The application’s data will persist in a MongoDB database. All code will be managed in a GitHub repository so that code changes can be easily documented and tracked throughout the project’s timeline. 

### Key Technical Design Decisions
<p>This application will be created in using the Spring framework. It will be designed in N-layer architecture and use a Model, View, Controller structure. This design structure was chosen because the app is mainly a create, read, update, delete (CRUD) application so the N-layer/MVC structure is an optimal solution. 
<p>The presentation layer will consist of all the viewable aspects of the application such as where users can view posts and account information. The business layer will hold all the logical actions for features such as logging in, registering, and making posts. The data access layer is responsible for reading data from the database to the business layer so that actions can be executed. This would include validating login credentials and editing posts. The data persistence layer is the database itself. All data for posts and user information will persist in the database/database persistence layer. The data will exist in a relational database using MySQL so that data can be organized in a structured format. This will make CRUD operations much simpler across the application.
<p>Along with N-layer architecture, this application will also utilize Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture. The models will be the container for all logic that relates to the application’s data. In this case, the user and post models. The controllers are responsible for handling all user requests and business logic of the application. This would include processing logins, registers, and making posts. Lastly, views will oversee all UI logic, including page navigation, text boxes, and buttons across the application.

## Database Design
The MongoDB database will be hosted through MongoDB Atlas. This removes a complex process of transfering all the data from a local system to cloud storage. The database will be split into 3 collections, the Users, Conversations, and Messages. Each collection has a conspending schema in the APIs code that enforces a standard layout as document databases don't enforce this. The users schema contains two lists of forgien keys. One is in the array of conversations, which is used to fetch all conversations that a user is a part of. The other is related to the contacts list. This is a reference to other user documents, so that anytime they update their information, it is also set to other users. The Messages colleciton is the only other place where foregin keys are used. This key is the conversationID, and is used to link the message to a single conversation.

## DevOps 
### Render Webhosting
## [https://send1t-api.onrender.com](https://send1t-api.onrender.com)
<p>The Send1t API is the only part of the application that is hosted. It is hosted using Render Web Service. This made delivering updates to my API much easier, as its connected to my Github repos main branch, so any major update is automaticlly built on Render. The MongoDB database is set up through MongoDB Atlas, which is hosted by AWS. This is auto scaled and I don't need to touch it, I just need my access token. 
  
## Logging
Logging exists at each HTTPs route within the API. This is handled by the logging fraemwork Morgan, which automatically records the route that the requst hit and the response code that was sent back, the time of the request, and how long the response took. This is sent to Renders internal hosting logs, from which I can download them if I so wish.
